# Γραφείο 

Γραφείο (greek for writing table) is an experiment in typography and editing.
It is intended to be eventually useful to authors who want to escape the dull look of modern books and to give them the tools to create beautiful art – content and layout.

## DEMO
You can [try it in your browser](https://grafeia.github.io/grafeia-wasm), if it supports WebGL2 (+EXT_color_buffer_float) and WebAssembly.
